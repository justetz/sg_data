WHEREAS declaration 3 of the Resolution requested that the governing body of the Rensselaer Union “take appropriate action to ensure the *Rensselaer Union Constitution*, and any other documents governing the affairs of the Rensselaer Union, are brought into conformance with the declarations of [the] Resolution;”

WHEREAS, in full cooperation with declaration 3 of the Resolution, the Grand Marshal and members of the Student Senate conducted a comprehensive review of the *Rensselaer Union Constitution* (“*Constitution*”);

WHEREAS the *Constitution*, a subsidiary document to *the Bylaws of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute* (“*the Bylaws of the Institute*”) and a grant of authority by the Board of Trustees, does not contain any provisions that conflict with *the Bylaws of the Institute*;

WHEREAS all other documents and policies governing affairs of the Rensselaer Union are subsidiary documents to the *Constitution* and do not contain any provisions that conflict with the *Constitution* and, by extension,  *the Bylaws of the Institute*;

WHEREAS the Board of Trustees last reviewed the *Union Constitution* following the events of March 2016 and determined that no changes were necessary;

WHEREAS the *Constitution* states the Executive Board “shall approve the hiring and continuance of all administrative personnel of the Union,” but does not state superintendence over hiring; and

WHEREAS, prior to the release of the Resolution, letters from administrators from the Division of Student Life indicated the importance of an approval vote by the Executive Board as part of the hiring process for a Director of the Union;

The Rensselaer Union 48th Student Senate hereby RESOLVES:
1. To reaffirm understanding that the *Rensselaer Union Constitution* receives all authority from the Board of Trustees,
2. To conclude that, upon review, the *Constitution*, as amended April 16, 2015, is in full conformance with the declarations of the Resolution,
3. To conclude that no provisions of the *Constitution* conflict with *the Bylaws of the Institute* and that, therefore, the document remains approved and in full effect,
4. To reaffirm the Executive Board’s involvement in the approval process for the hiring of a candidate for the Director of the Union position, as specified in Article VII, Section 2, Item (f) of the *Constitution*, where a candidate cannot be hired without the successful completion of the approval process,
5. To affirm the ultimate authority of the President in deciding the employment of the Director of the Union, and
6. To confirm the integrity of the Rensselaer Union’s status as a student-run Union, including all responsibilities granted to the student body by the *Constitution*, within the jurisdiction of *the Bylaws of the Institute* and all policies of the Board of Trustees.</text>

  <description>Endorsement of Select Revisions to the Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilites</description>
  <text>The Rensselaer Union 48th Student Senate hereby RESOLVES:

1. To endorse the following edits to the *Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities*, as proposed by the Student Life Committee on November 8, 2017 by a vote of 11-0-0:
    1. Global Changes
        1. Removed all Handbook dates. 
        2. All office names and titles have been updated. 
    2. Grounds for Disciplinary Action
        1. 10\. Physical assault “or conduct that threatens, encourages, or causes physical harm to persons or property.”
        2. 12\. Willful failure or refusal… “or where the procedures governing the investigation or proceeding expressly grant a right of non-participation”
        3. 13\. Conduct which endangers the safety of the Institute community, including, but not limited to, tampering with fire-warning devices, “fire protection systems, portable fire extinguishers, and other fire safety equipment…”
    3. Components of the Judicial System
        1. Under the Judicial Inquiry Section, “In addition, at the sole discretion of the Dean of Students Office, and to the extent applicable law permits, a copy of the letter may be sent to the student's parent(s) or guardian(s)”
        2. Under the Grounds for Appeal section, Note addendum, “A mandatory minimum sanction cannot be reduced or appealed, other than for mitigation purposes relating to organizations as specified in the Good Samaritan Policy.”
        3. Under the Judicial Hearing Boards section, Judicial Board subsection, “The Judicial Board has jurisdiction… except where other Institute policies or procedures grant jurisdiction to other panels (e.g., Sexual Misconduct Policy)...”
        4. Under the Judicial Hearing Boards section, Review Board subsection, “The decision of a lower board (other than the Faculty Academic Board) may be appealed to the Review Board, by either party.”
    4. Record of Disciplinary Action
        1. Changed titled to “Disclosure of Disciplinary Action”
        2. Removed the paragraph stating that the Judicial System determines the length of time a disciplinary action will remain on student record because that language was not reflective of current practice. 
        3. Clarified that “Any disciplinary action can be disclosed to federal, state, or local government entity, law, enforcement, licensing or certification board, or corporate entity upon request of said agency if and only if: (a) by subpoena or binding order of a court or government agency, or  (b) a student signs a confidentiality waiver for said agency or government entity, or (c) such disclosure is otherwise in compliance with state and federal laws, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA).”
    5. Policy on Transcript Notation
        1. Removed all references to “Student Code of Conduct” as that is not the name Rensselaer gives to its Handbook and policies.

        1. Made clarifying changes to the Faculty  Procedures for responding to Academic Dishonesty that were recommended by the Academic Dishonesty Task Force.

            2. Further information was added to include how this form would be handled.

        1. Changed title to “Non-Discrimination/Harassment Prevention/Equal Opportunity Policy”

        3. Added information about reporting and external reporting options. 
        4. Moved discrimination/harassment/retaliation reporting subsection from the Sexual Misconduct section to this section, as it covers a broader set of conduct that better fits here. 
        5. Updated reporting channels to include Public Safety and full title of AVP &amp; Dean of Students. 
    8. Computer Use at Rensselaer 
        1. Made updates to reflect the new cyber-citizenship policy (previously passed). 
    9. Security Technology, Access Control System, and Emergency Phones
        1. Created this section 
            1. “The Institute has installed security technology, access control system, emergency exit alarms, and emergency phones to facilitate the safety and security of the campus. Tampering with the security cameras, access control devices, emergency exit alarms, and/or emergency phones creates a safety and security risk and are serious offenses which will be treated as such.

        2. Adding a paragraph at the end of the introduction stating:
            1. “Changes to this Handbook shall be made if and only if there is direct involvement by the Student Life Committee and the changes are approved by the Student Senate by a ⅔ majority vote.
        3. Student Conduct for Individuals and Groups
            1. “Any invasion of individual rights of privacy or activity… is strictly forbidden for all Rensselaer students.”

  <text>WHEREAS the Student Senate is aware of the judicial processes underway involving members of the Rensselaer Union in relation to the peaceful demonstration that occurred on October 13th, 2017;

WHEREAS the Student Senate reaffirms the right for the Dean of Students Office, when there is evidence to cause concern of a possible Grounds for Disciplinary Action (GDA), to start a judicial process;

WHEREAS the Student Senate has heard the witness testimony of one of the members standing accused of three (3) counts of GDA violations and understands that both accused students did not organize the peaceful demonstration held on October 13th, 2017;

WHEREAS the Student Senate is fully aware of the failure to fulfill the duty charged to the Dean of Students Office to either alert, or have a designee alert, students in the event of a GDA violation to allow said violators to correct themselves (e.g. “comply”); and

1. To urge for the immediate cancellations of judicial processes involving the peaceful demonstration against the students who attended said peaceful demonstration,

3. To recognize the actions taken by the Dean of Students Office as violations of the *Rensselaer Handbook of Student Rights and Responsibilities*, specifically the *Student Bill of Rights*, Article V, Section D.</text>
